Especially in the past three years, the linkage between domestic and foreign capital markets has increased, and the domestic stocks and bond exchange market has often been subjected to similar liquidity shocks. In order to comprehensively reflect the changes in liquidity in financial markets and their impacts, we conduct comprehensive observations of various factors affecting liquidity in the financial markets from open market operations, interest rates, foreign exchange, stocks, funds, etc., and continue to follow the trend of regulatory policies to grasp in a timely manner. The regularization of financial markets.<a id="more"></a><br>The core view<br>According to the data of the first quarter of 2018, the net value of the five special funds for deposits totaled 74.14 billion yuan, a decrease of approximately 176.1 billion yuan compared to the end of 2017 ; this was mainly due to the substantial reduction of fund shares and net fund redemption of nearly 70% . As a result, all fund positions have been passively upgraded, and the average position has increased from 20.2% at the end of 2017 to 49.7% . The Securities Customization Fund was established to stabilize market confidence during the stock market disaster and played an important role in mitigating market liquidity pressures and resolving risks. With the smooth return of the A-share market, part of the funds began to slowly exit. 2 017 Nian Some securities companies to disclose semi-annual report trends in the exit of its bailout money; from the beginning of the second half of last year, five card gold funds are also being customized to lighten up. At present, the withdrawal of rescue funds is required for market development, but it is impossible to reduce the holdings in a short period of time. Instead, the scale of funds can be gradually and orderlyly reduced through multiple channels. The market need not worry excessively.<br>From April 16th to April 20th , a net repurchase of RMB 470 billion was reversed , and the 366.5 billion MLF due was fully renewal and the interest rate was raised by 5bp . The central bank released a large amount of liquidity to ease the pressure on the tax fund . On the 17th, the central bank announced the “half-replacement of replacement MLF”, which released about 1.3 trillion yuan of funds, which can basically hedge the maturity of MLF in the second quarter. This is another way to ease liquidity shortage under strict supervision. It helps to improve liquidity stratification, but monetary policy has not been turned.<br>With  regard to interest rates, short-term liquidity has become seasonally tight, and the liquidity improvement brought about by the expected reduction has caused the yield of government bonds to continue to fall. The issuance of interest rates for deposit certificates of various industries has generally declined. As of April 20, R007 soared 180.8bp to 4.6% from the previous period. The DR007 increased 34.8bp to 3.04% from the previous period, and the spread widened by 146.1bp. The one-year and 10-year Treasury yields fell by 19.5bp, 18.5bp to 3.01%, and 3.52%, respectively, and the maturity spread widened by 1.1bp to 0.52%.<br>From  April 16 to April 20 , the liquidity of the A- share market was slightly tightened. The liquidity index of the A- share investment was 1.06 , down by 0.45 .

In addition, the financing purchase amount for the week was 195.16 billion yuan, accounting for 8.29% of the turnover of the A-shares, which was a slight increase of 0.1% from the previous period and was at a relatively low level in the past year. Concerns over overseas markets and trade frictions between China and the United States leave investors cautious.<br>In terms of holding  positions of funds, the overall position of stock and hybrid funds (April 19 ) was 0.26% lower than the previous period (April 12 ) , 0.27% to 92.01% , 82.3% .

<p>####I. The topic of mobility<br>From April 16 to April 20 , the reverse repurchase period last week reached 20 billion yuan, and 490 billion yuan was put in place . A net deposit of 470 billion yuan was provided for the entire week , and the 14- day reverse repurchase operation rate was raised by 5bp to 2.7% . Another RMB 367.5 billion MLF expires and is fully renewal. The interest rate is raised by 5bp to 3.3%; the cash reserve of the State Treasury is due and fully hedged to RMB 80 billion. On April 17, the central bank announced that from April 25 onwards, the reserve requirement ratio for large-scale commercial banks, joint-stock commercial banks, city commercial banks, non-county rural commercial banks, and foreign banks was reduced by one percentage point.

The scale of releasing funds through the RRR cut is about RMB 1.3 trillion, which can basically hedge the maturity of the MLF in the second quarter. This is another way to ease the liquidity shortage in the context of strict supervision, and it is conducive to improving the liquidity stratification. Monetary policy has not changed.<br>According to the data released in the first quarter of 2018, the net value of the five securities custom funds established during the rescue period totaled 74.14 billion yuan, a decrease of approximately 176.1 billion yuan compared to the end of 2017; this was mainly due to the substantial reduction in the fund’s share. Since the establishment of the funds in 2015, the total share of the funds is about 40 billion, which has dropped to about 12 billion in the first quarter of 2018, and the net redemption of funds has been nearly 70%. The total size of the fund’s shareholdings was 35.52 billion yuan, a decrease of 12.76 billion yuan (about 26%) from the end of 2017, much lower than the fund redemption ratio. Therefore, all fund positions have been passively increased by a large margin, and the average position has increased from 20.2% at the end of 2017 to 49.7%.<br>Judging from the holding of stocks, with the exception of consumption activity in the south, the top ten stocks of other funds are basically stable, and the number of shares held is slightly adjusted. The five funds in 2017Q4 will lighten up some of the blue-chip stocks in different degrees. The heavy-duty stocks that are lightened in the first quarter of 2018 include Bank of Communications, China Merchants Bank, Shanghai Pudong Development Bank, and Yili Securities. The South China Consumer Dynamics Quarterly pointed out that taking into account uncertainties such as the Fed’s continued interest rate hikes and Sino-US trade conflicts, the fund continued to maintain its neutral positions, allocated blue-chip stocks with low valuations, and focused on long-term allocation value.<br>The Securities Customization Fund was established to stabilize market confidence during the stock market disaster and played an important role in mitigating market liquidity pressures and resolving risks. With the return of the A-share market to a stable return, and large-cap blue-chip stocks have emerged from a wave of structural bull market, some funds began to withdraw slowly. In the semi-annual report of some securities companies in 2017, the withdrawal trend of their rescue funds was disclosed; from the second half of last year, five custom funds for securities funds were also gradually lightening up.<br>In order to ensure the orderly withdrawal of funds, the Development Research Center of the State Council issued the “Proposal on the Operation and Orderly Withdrawal of Rescue Funds” at the beginning of the year. It states that “the current rescue mission has been completed and the market has returned to normal. The rescue funds have interfered with market operations, and People’s interests and interests, and the divestment of funds, etc., and other market experience also show that the rescue funds should be withdrawn as soon as possible after the successful rescue.” Therefore, the withdrawal of rescue funds is required for market development, but it cannot be reduced in a short time. Holding, but through a variety of channels to gradually reduce the scale of funds, without excessive anxiety.<br>Second, regulatory dynamics<br>Third, monetary policy tools and capital costs<br>From April 16 to April 20 , the reverse repurchase period last week reached 20 billion yuan, and 490 billion yuan was put in place .
