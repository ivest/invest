The “Sanxin Economy” was first written into the Politburo meeting materials. It is a concrete example of the “Position of new kinetic energy” held by the Politburo meeting. It may also be an important part of the central government’s “direction of expanding domestic demand.” For the core technology industries, the support path at the policy level has long been very clear (from the 19th National Congress to the top-level landing policies), and at the industrial level, “data realization” as one of the core drivers of the Wi-Fi revolution will bring the foundation Layer hardware (integrated circuits, OLEDs, servers, etc.) and application layer (cloud computing, industrial Internet, artificial intelligence, etc.) continue to develop.<a id="more"></a></p>
<p>The core view<br>[This week’s topic thinking]:<br>The most important addition to this week’s Politburo meeting was “strengthening key core technologies and actively supporting new industries, new models, and new business developments”. We believe that strengthening the key core technologies is clearly aimed at the recent US confrontation. China’s science and technology company chip embargo, the Central Political Bureau meeting once again stressed that the central government attaches great importance to the core technology research. The Sanxin economy was first written into the Politburo meeting materials, which is a concrete example of the “new kinetic energy” being held by the Central Political Bureau meeting. It may also be an important part of the central government’s direction for “expanding domestic demand.”<br>Therefore, for the core technology industries, the policy-level support path has long been clear. From the 2017 report, the 19th National Congress emphasized the “accelerate the building of manufacturing powerhouses” and “accelerate the development of advanced manufacturing industries” to promote the Internet, big data, artificial intelligence and the real economy. With deep integration, by the end of the year, the Central Economic Work Conference continued to emphasize “China’s manufacturing has created a transformation to China, strengthened scientific and technological innovation, and cultivated a number of vanguard companies with innovative capabilities”. In the government work report of 2018, it once again stressed that “Strengthening the national innovation system; We will implement and improve innovation and incentive policies; promote popular entrepreneurship and innovation to the highest levels; and then this Politburo meeting will make the new momentum more imaginary. That is, the direction of “expanding domestic demand” will most likely focus on the “three new economy”. Various detailed policies to support emerging industries have also gradually come to the ground. The top-level and landing policies have been fully rolled out. At the industrial level, we are currently on the eve of a new round of scientific and technological revolution. This round of the machine revolution centered on what we call “intellectual networking” will once again change people’s lives and production in the next 5 to 10 years. One of the core logics driving the Wisdom Revolution is “data realization.” The realization of data will bring the continuous development of the base layer hardware (integrated circuits, OLEDs, servers) and application layers (cloud computing, industrial Internet, artificial intelligence, etc.). Continue to be optimistic about the continuous excess revenue from the core technological topics (independent innovation/domestic substitution [IC/cloud computing/big data/industrial internet/innovative drug/OLED/military etc.]) brought by policy and industry two-wheel drive .<br>[Important topic tracking this week]<br>(1) Nuclear power: Wang Yirong, deputy director of the National Defense Science, Technology and Industry Bureau, recently stated that “the current nuclear fuel industrial park program has been completed and completed.” In the future, China will optimize the layout of the nuclear fuel industry and build a nuclear fuel industry with national competitiveness in the southeastern coastal areas where nuclear power is relatively concentrated. Park, providing one-stop service for the development of nuclear power; the “Guidelines for Energy Work in 2018” promulgated by the National Energy Administration put forward plans to start 6-8 units in the year; April 19th, “Hualong No. 1” - Fuqing No. 5 The two low-pressure rotors with a weight of 280 tons each were completed and decommissioned in Deyang, Sichuan, marking the completion of the development of the first conventional gas turbine host equipment for Hualong No. 1 and related stocks (China Nuclear Power, China Nuclear Power Construction, etc.).<br>(2) Big data, digital China: Vice Minister of Industry and Information Chen Xiongxiong: promotes the development of big data in four aspects; on April 21, the Fuzhou Municipal Government issued the “Seven Measures on Accelerating the Development of the Digital Economy”; April 24, the First Digital China Construction The closing ceremony of the summit was held in Fuzhou. At the closing ceremony, the “Policy for the Informationization of the National Procuratorate System”, “The Internet + Chinese Civilization”: Promoting the Protection and Utilization of Cultural Relics with Digital Information,” and “151 Digital Satellites for the New Era Digital Fujian” were released. Demonstration project related content interpretation, “National Hospital Information Construction Standards and Norms” and many other related policies, related stocks (Huanhuanxinwang, Dongfangwangli, Taiji, Philips, Meiyabike, etc.).<br>(3) IC: 36-year-old quoted Reuters reported that as trade frictions between China and the United States continue to escalate, the Chinese government is seeking to accelerate the development plan of the domestic chip industry. The Reuters report quoted a person familiar with the matter as saying that senior Chinese officials gathered industry associations and regulators this week to hold several meetings to discuss specific measures to further accelerate the development of the local chip industry. The National IC Industrial Investment Fund is also said to be among the participating agencies, and related stocks (North Huachuang, Changjiang Electronics Technology, Zhaoyi Innovation, etc.).<br>(4) Quantum calculations and quantum communication: On April 20th, Professor Duan Luming’s research group of the Institute of Cross-Informatics of Tsinghua University published a “Self-controlled Quantum Interface” entitled “Scientific Progress” in the journal Science. “The entanglement of experimental realization” research paper.

<li>This week’s theme reflection: The Politburo meeting will adjust the specific direction of expanding domestic demand.<br>Last week, we proposed that the U.S. trade war is directed at “Made in China 2025”, reflecting that the United States began to jealousy of the rise of China in the mid-to-high-end manufacturing sector. In the long run, China must accelerate the pace of domestic independent innovation, and the domestic technology of cutting-edge technology industries. If necessary, the country will increase its support for the short board industry (integrated circuits, etc.) with greater probability than expected, long-term optimistic about the themes of major nations (integrated circuits, cloud computing, innovative drugs, OLED, military, etc.), and market reactions. It also basically meets our expectations.<br>This week, when the Politburo meeting was convened, the most important new expression was “strengthening key core technologies and actively supporting new industries, new models, and new business developments”. We believe that strengthening the key core technologies is clearly aimed at the recent occurrence of the United States. As for the chip embargo imposed by Chinese technology companies, the Central Political Bureau meeting once again emphasized that the central government attaches great importance to the core technology research. The Sanxin Economy was first written into the Politburo meeting materials. It was the political politburo meeting’s presentation of “new kinetic energy”. The new kinetic energy was a word repeatedly mentioned by the Central Political Bureau, but what was the new kinetic energy in different meetings? There are different expressions. This time the “three news” will make the new kinetic energy more imaginary and may also be an important part of the central government’s “direction for expanding domestic demand”.<br>From the perspective of the theme:<br>The support path at the policy level has long been clear. From the 2017 Nineteenth Congress report, we will emphasize “accelerating the building of a manufacturing powerhouse” and “accelerating the development of advanced manufacturing industries” to promote the deep integration of the Internet, big data, artificial intelligence, and the real economy to the end of the year. The work conference continued to emphasize “China’s manufacturing has created a transformation to China, strengthened scientific and technological innovation, and cultivated a number of vanguard companies with innovative capabilities”. In the government work report of 2018, it once again stressed that “Strengthening national innovation system construction; implement and improve innovation incentive policies; Promoting popular entrepreneurship and innovation to the highest levels, and then to this Politburo meeting, the new kinetic energy will be more imaginative. That is, the direction of “expanding domestic demand” will most likely focus on the “three new economy”. The policy has also gradually landed, so the policy from the top to the ground has been fully rolled out.<br>At the industrial level, we are currently on the eve of a new round of scientific and technological revolution. This round of the machine revolution centered on what we call “intellectual networking” will once again change people’s lives and production in the next 5 to 10 years. One of the core logics driving the Wisdom Revolution is “data realization.” So far, the Internet has undergone three changes: the first is the Internet era represented by IBM hardware and MS software; the second is the mobile Internet era represented by Apple’s mobile devices and Tencent social software; the third is We are now experiencing the era of the Internet of Everything represented by NVIDIA’s artificial intelligence and Amazon Cloud Computing. At the same time, the profit model of the Internet industry has also gone through three stages - information realisation, traffic realisation and data realisation, and data realisation will lead to base layer hardware (integrated circuits, OLEDs, servers) and application layers (cloud computing, industrial Internet, The continuous development of artificial intelligence, etc.)<br>Therefore, the two-wheel drive at the policy and industry level will lead to the continued excess of core technology topics (independent innovation/domestic substitution [IC/cloud computing/big data/industrial internet/innovative drug/OLED/military etc.]).<br>(1) integrated circuit [continue follow]<br>At present, a new round of industrial changes is being driven by the Internet of Things (IoT), and the superposition of external factors has forced semiconductors to become localized. In 2018, the country will work hard to promote strategic emerging industries such as smart grids, artificial intelligence, 5G, and the Internet of Things. These industries have huge demand for semiconductors. According to the prospective industry research institute, China’s semiconductor market demand will increase from US$213 billion to US$262 billion by 2017-2020, CAGR will increase to 7.15%, and semiconductor self-supply rate is expected to increase from 11.2% to 15%. Nevertheless, 85% Demand still depends on imports, and the problem of supply shortage is rather severe.<br>In terms of policy, as China’s implementation of the first decade of manufacturing power strategy, “Made in China 2025” puts forward clear requirements for the localization of semiconductor equipment: Before 2020, the localization rate of 90~32 nanometer process equipment will reach 50%. , To realize the localization of 90nm lithography machine, the localization rate of key equipment for sealing and testing has reached 50%. Before 2025, the localization rate of 20 to 14 nanometer process equipment reached 30%, which enabled localization of immersion lithography machines. By 2030, localization of 18-inch process equipment, EUV lithography machines, and packaging and testing equipment will be realized. In addition, the Chinese government promotes industrial development through policy promotion and the use of large funds, and enhances the technological level and international competitiveness of China’s semiconductor industry through market-based investment methods such as mergers and acquisitions. In September 2014, the National Integrated Circuit Industrial Investment Fund was established and established. The initial scale was 120 billion yuan. In addition, it is reported that the establishment of the second phase of the major fund has already started and it is planned to raise 150 billion to 200 billion yuan. It is planned to be completed this year. The central government, some state-owned enterprises, and some local governments will all contribute, and will focus on the national strategy. Investment planning for emerging industries, such as: smart cars, artificial intelligence, Internet of things, 5G, etc.<br>It can be seen that the current development of the integrated circuit industry in China has reached a new stage and the development of the industrial chain has been gradually improved. However, some links are still weak, and the self-sufficiency rate is still low. With the continuous development of smart devices, artificial intelligence, and automotive electronics, etc. Will continue to promote the development of China’s semiconductor industry, the establishment of the second phase of the large fund and government work report will “promote the development of integrated circuit industry” in a prominent position to help the domestic semiconductor industry into a new stage of development, the relevant industrial chain will continue to benefit. The China Merchants Electronics Group believes that the development opportunities for the semiconductor industry in the mainland in the next ten years will undoubtedly be determined. From the perspective of industrial transfer, attention will be paid to the construction of domestic production lines and overseas M&amp;A opportunities. In terms of the industrial chain, it is recommended to pay attention to [Northern China Creation Co., Ltd.] [Long Electric Technology] [Sanan Optoelectronics] [Ziguang Guoxin] [Huiding Technology] [Jingsheng Electromechanical] and so on.<br>(2) Big data [continue follow]<br>Big data, as an important strategic resource in the Internet era, is an important part of the game between big countries. With the advent of the Internet of Everything and the development of data analysis technologies, massive data will become an important tool for national security and government supervision. In recent years, the country’s emphasis on big data has increased. Chairman Xi Jinping proposed the “National Big Data Center for National Integration” to promote technology integration, business integration, and data in the 36th collective learning strategy of the “Strong Network” strategy in October 2016. Integration, cross-level, cross-regional, cross-system, cross-department, and cross-service collaboration management and services,” Zhang Feng, chief engineer of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, mentioned at the “2017 World Telecommunication and Information Society Day” conference in May 2017 The national integrated data center will be built to promote the opening of public data and the sharing of basic data resources across departments and regions. On December 8th, Chairman Xi Jinping emphasized the promotion of the second group study on the implementation of the national big data strategy. Implement the national big data strategy, speed up the improvement of digital infrastructure, promote the integration and open sharing of data resources, ensure data security, speed up the construction of digital China, and better serve China’s economic and social development and improvement of people’s lives. The government work report in 2018 puts the “implementation of big data development action” in a prominent position. Therefore, in the era of digital economy 2.0, data has become the core force driving the innovation and development of business models. The re-emphasis on the country’s big data strategy has once again prompted businesses in the digital economy infrastructure, industrial manufacturing intelligence, government big data, and information security. The growth. For the industry chain, it is recommended to pay attention to 【Abecco】[Yihualu][Oriental Guoxin].<br>(3) Quantum calculation, quantum communication [continue follow]<br>event:<br>On March 6, Google announced the launch of a universal quantum computer with 72 qubits, Bristlecone, which achieved a low error rate of 1%, which is equal to the quantum computer with 9 qubits. Google believes that the use of Bristlecone can achieve quantum hegemony. Last week, IBM revealed the internal structure of its 50 quantum-bit quantum prototypes. (Phoenix Technology)<br>On March 8th, Baidu announced the establishment of the Institute of Quantum Computing to conduct research on quantum computing software and information technology application business. Baidu plans to build a world-class quantum computing institute within five years and gradually integrate quantum computing into its business. (Tencent Technology)<br>On March 9th, Pan Jianwei, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference and leader of China’s quantum communication research, introduced that after achieving the world’s first quantum intercontinental communication between Beijing and Vienna last year, many countries have proposed cooperation intentions to participate in the project. This year, China will begin intercontinental quantum communications with Italy, Russia, and Germany. Pan Jianwei also said that this year will strive to launch the “quantum communications global network” pre-research project, will launch 4 to 5 quantum satellites in succession, to achieve high and low orbit satellite network. (CCTV News)<br>On March 29th, Microsoft researchers published a paper in Nature that gave them strong evidence that they found the presence of angel particles, Mayorana Fermi, who split electrons in half in specially prepared wires. This work is of great significance, at least in the field of artificial preparation/regulation and manipulation of quantum states. It has contributed to the development and application of quantum information science. They think that they will get a working qubit before the end of the year. (New Zhiyuan)<br>On April 20th, Professor Duan Luming’s research group of the Institute of Cross-Informatics of Tsinghua University published a study entitled “Experimentation of Entanglement between 25 Independently Controllable Quantum Interfaces” in the “Science and Progress” of the “Science” periodical. paper. The study for the first time achieved quantum entanglement among the 25 quantum interfaces, which was approximately six times the number of interfaces compared to the previous world record of entanglement between the four quantum interfaces maintained by the Caltech research group.<br>The birth of quantum mechanics has profoundly changed the human world. Semiconductors and nuclear energy have revolutionized society as a whole. Today, quantum information technology formed by the combination of quantum subphysics and information technology has once again promoted the development of the technological revolution. Quantum computing and quantum communication are spears and shields in quantum information technology. Because of the powerful performance of quantum computing, in addition to national defense security, it will play an important role in scientific research, medical care, and other fields. Therefore, each country and even the company level have competed for each other. The world is in a “quantum computing hegemony competition.” From the perspective of communication security, many countries have raised the security of communications to the national security level. Because of the incommensurable nature of quantum communications, the development of quantum communications is imperative. China is no exception. Since 2013, it has gradually formulated policies to support quantum communication research, and has increased quantum communications to national strategies in the “Thirteenth Five-Year Plan”.<br>Under the support of the national policy, China’s quantum communication technology has taken a leading position in the world; in addition, the industrialization of quantum communications is also at the leading level in the world. With the “One-Stop and One-Star” major project has been the first to land, it has already achieved the “Beijing-Shanghai Trunk Line”. “Connected with Mozi” constitutes the world’s first integrated practical and wide-area quantum communication network.<br>Although quantum computing and quantum communication are still in the early stages, as the new computing technology and communication technology, the unique advantages of parallel high-speed computing will be conducive to solving the requirements of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence for computing power. Attention can be paid to quantum computing, Quantum communications related research and deployment of listed companies, can be concerned about the silver wheel shares / Zhejiang Oriental / Hengtong Photoelectric / China Labor and Technology / China Information and Ascension Technology.<br>(4) Military workers [Add focus]<br>Recently, according to Sina’s report, the latest photos of domestic carrier aircraft show that the first domestic aircraft carrier phased array radar parked at Dalian Shipyard has been installed and the scaffolding has been completely removed. This indicates that the main equipment of the aircraft carrier has been installed, and the sea trial will be conducted after the corresponding commissioning. The aircraft carrier is expected to complete the trial this year.<br>At present, China’s high-end shipbuilding industry is gradually moving toward independent innovation. From a technology-intensive perspective, the technology density of military ships is among the highest in the shipbuilding industry. The independent innovation of high-end shipbuilding industry will bring about the integration and development of multiple industries. In May 2016, the State Council issued the Outline of the National Innovation Driven Development Strategy. It clearly stated that it is necessary to “innovate the industrial technology system, create new advantages in development,” and develop “marine engineering equipment and high-tech ships”. The old system of the high-tech shipbuilding industry will face New opportunities will break through the transition in the context of the downturn in the industry and take the high-end and self-reliant route. The powerful civilian participation in the armed forces will usher in the greatest opportunities.<br>Entering 2018, China’s new naval warships will continue to increase their water supply. Under the strategic goal of building a maritime power in the country, it is expected that the demand for naval equipment will continue to grow at a high rate. With the gradual development of aircraft carrier combat group construction, further progress will be made. Open up huge market space. The China Merchants Military Group believes that in the continuing downturn of the civilian shipping market, it is expected that China will enter the peak of domestic aircraft carrier construction in the future, and it is optimistic that the aircraft carrier battle group construction will bring investment opportunities for shipbuilding and carrier-based aircraft industries. It is recommended to pay attention to China Shipbuilding Defense, China Shipbuilding, China Shipbuilding Technology, and China Power.<br>(5) Precision Medical [Continue attention]<br>On March 12th, the National Food and Drug Administration reviewed the approving of Kingsley (Nanjing Legend) CAR-T cell therapy clinical trial application. In addition, Anke Biotechnology, Hengrui Pharmaceutical, Galaxy Biological, Fosun Pharma and other listed companies The relevant companies have declared. In terms of policies, since the concept of “precise medical care” has been proposed, the government has repeatedly introduced policies to support the development of the precision medical industry. As far as technology is concerned, China is already in the top echelon of the world in precision medicine and has emerged a large number of precision medical enterprises with large-scale distribution of life science and technology. Segmentation areas: Gene sequencing - China’s upstream equipment is still relatively weak. Although BGI and Huainkang have already started self-research equipment, Berry and Kang have adopted cooperative development models, but they still need to rely heavily on imports. CAR-T, which is mostly at home and abroad during the exploratory period, has no obvious foreign leading advantages. At the same time, because of relatively loose supervision and relatively low clinical costs, it has given Chinese companies an opportunity to catch up with CAR-T therapy. . It is recommended to focus on gene sequencing (HuaDa gene, Berry gene), cellular immunotherapy (Anke biological, Hengrui medicine, Fosun medicine), and diagnosis (Dean diagnosis).<br>For the specific logic, see the Thematic Rise of Themes of the Great Powers (Innovative Medicine, 5G, Integrated Circuits, Cloud Computing, etc.) in the 0320 Thematic Weekly.<br>(6) Innovative drugs [Add focus]<br>At the end of 2017, the CFDA issued the “Opinions on Encouraging the Priority Assessment, Approval, and Approval of Drug Innovation”, and the purpose of the priority review approval was adjusted to encourage innovation, and a real-time update of the “China Listed Drug List” was issued to include and approve listings. Innovative drugs, improved new drugs, new generic drugs in chemical classifications, and specific information for assessing drugs by consistency of quality and efficacy. In addition, the organizational reform plan of the medical-related State Council last week put forward that the Fujian model will set the direction of medical reform. The China Merchants Medicine Group believes that this model is designed to promote drug price competition. Therefore, in the short term, the species that first adopted the consistency assessment will first enjoy the benefits of import substitution. In the long run, generic drugs will be a homogenized low price. competition. Therefore, innovative drug companies are even more scarce. Only innovative drugs can get rid of low-price competition and seize market share. Companies that take the lead in innovative drug distribution will enjoy long-term valuation premiums.<br>The golden age of China’s innovative drugs will gradually start. From the outside, the quality of drugs is mentioned in the same position as sales. The barriers to entry and payment of innovative medicines and health insurance are gradually removed; on the other hand, from the perspective of internal enterprises, enterprises will The investment in R&amp;D will be increased. In addition, listed pharmaceutical companies with capital advantages will establish increasingly sophisticated product pipelines through various means such as acquisitions, licensing, etc. The combination of capital and industry will bring tremendous opportunities for innovative drugs. Therefore, under the top-down policy dividend, high-quality innovative pharmaceutical companies urgently need to revalue their value, and hope to usher in more than expected performance in reviewing and approving batches.<br>For the benefit of individual stocks, the China Merchants Medicine Group believes that Xinlitai is the leader in low-value innovative drugs that are currently scarce in the market. At present, the company’s existing product echelon is reasonable, and its support performance maintains a steady growth. The follow-up market is large. The company has strengthened R&amp;D investment in recent years and has already ranked among the top-ranking R&amp;D companies in the country. Its pipeline reserves are abundant, but its valuation is significantly lower than that of its peers. In addition, it is recommended to pay attention to Changchun Hi-tech, a leading genetic engineering drug in China.<br>(7) OLED [continue to follow]<br>The recent BOE A announcement, the company plans to invest 46.5 billion yuan in Chongqing to build the sixth-generation AMOLED (flexible) production line project, the main product positioning for high-end AMOLED mobile display and emerging mobile display products.<br>OLEDs, organic light emitting displays, are known as “dream displays.” OLED display technology differs from traditional LCD display methods in that it does not require a backlight, uses a very thin organic material coating and a glass substrate, and has a larger viewing angle and can significantly reduce power consumption. At present, the global new display industry has maintained a steady growth trend, and the large screen size has become a new impetus for the development of the industry. AMOLED’s penetration rate in the medium and small-sized product markets has risen rapidly.<br>The attention of global consumer electronics giants, display technology upgrades, OLED panel ushered in growth point. With the improvement of technology, production capacity and demand, the speed of OLED industrialization will further accelerate, bringing an impact on the LCD-based display industry system. According to IHS data, the global display industry reached 3.827 billion in 2017. Industrial revenue reached US$127.2 billion. In terms of technology, OLED shipments reached 464 million units and revenue reached $25.2 billion. It is estimated that by 2022, the global display industry scale will reach nearly 4 billion, of which OLED will exceed 900 million, and the compound annual growth rate will reach 14.2%. From the revenue point of view, by 2022, global display industry revenue will reach 138 billion US dollars, of which OLED is about 42.1 billion US dollars, the compound annual growth rate of 18%.<br>The overall strength of China’s display industry continues to increase, and the global market share has steadily expanded. China is currently the world’s largest OLED application market, of which more than 45% of IT products are related to display devices. With the further decline in the cost of OLED panels and further improvement in production capacity, the level of application in other consumer electronics products will also increase in the future. Therefore, China has great potential for developing the OLED industry. In terms of domestic producers, leading domestic companies represented by BOE and Shenzhen Tianma have accelerated the adjustment of their industrial structure, accelerated the layout of oversize, AMOLED and industrial chain construction, and the industry as a whole has entered a healthy development track. In addition, color TV manufacturers such as Skyworth, Changhong, Konka also introduced a number of OLED TVs.<br>In terms of the industrial chain, it is recommended to pay attention to BOE A, the leading OLED company in China, Han’s laser in the upstream equipment company, and precision electronics.<br>(8) Industrial Internet [Continue attention]<br>After 20 years of development of the Internet, the investment dividend period has passed. The smart era of 5G+artificial intelligence+Internet of Things is accelerating. With the help of infrastructure and device intelligence, the application of Internet of Things (IoT) such as industrial Internet of Things (IoT) is accelerating and is entering an outbreak period. On the policy level, from the guidance document issued by the State Council on “Intensifying the Internet + Advanced Manufacturing Industry to Develop the Industrial Internet” issued by the State Council in November last year, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology released the “National Leading Group for Manufacturing Powerful Country Construction” on February 24th. The notice of the Industrial Internet Special Working Group will make it clear to the government work report in 2018 that “developing an industrial Internet platform” and “creating a China manufacturing 2025 demonstration area” will continue to promote top-level policies that will help China’s smart manufacturing to enter a new stage of development. It is also conducive to China’s catching up with the new round of industrial manufacturing reforms in the world. The industrial Internet has huge space. It will play a greater role in promoting the transformation and upgrading of chemical industries and cultivating new kinetic energy, and will continue to stimulate new modes, new formats, and new industries. . In terms of the industry chain, it is recommended to pay attention to high-level emerging technologies, Dongdu Technology and other Internet of Things and industrial Internet leaders (recommended by China Merchants Communication Group), and UFIDA.com’s “Hande Information” and “KenStar” (recommended by the Merchants Computer Group).<br>The specific logic can be seen in the theme week of February 28, observing that the theme of science and technology is on the right and attention is focused on 5G, Industrial Internet (big topic, strong certainty).<br>(9) Artificial Intelligence [Continue to follow]<br>We have already proposed in our annual strategy for 2018 that AI-related policies are unprecedented and AI has entered the golden age. At the policy level, domestic artificial intelligence policies continue to be issued, and top-level strategies strongly support them. After receiving the attention of Secretary Xi Jinping in 2013, the government has issued corresponding policy support every year.<br>In November 2017, the Ministry of Technology held the “New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan” and the Launching Ceremony of Major Science and Technology Projects, and announced the first batch of national new generation artificial intelligence open innovation platform list. The convening of the conference marked the development of a new generation of artificial intelligence. And major scientific and technological projects have entered the stage of full implementation. From a technical perspective, both domestic and international technology giants have accelerated their deployment, and artificial intelligence has ushered in explosive development opportunities. Currently including international tech giants such as Google have entered the field of artificial intelligence, IBM’s strategic core “Smart World” plan for the next decade and Intel’s R &amp; D + acquisition to grab artificial intelligence chips, all show that overseas technology giants are currently accelerating the field of artificial intelligence deployment.<br>From the perspective of application areas and market size, current artificial intelligence is mainly used in security, finance, medical care, automotive and service industries, and the market scale has rapidly increased. The market demand for various types of weak artificial intelligence products such as voice recognition and machine vision has been further improved.

<li>This week’s core views &amp; recommendations:<br>The U.S. Department of Commerce issued a ban on the export of electronic components to ZTE. The evolution of the incident remains to be seen. There may be a turn for the better. However, from the perspective of the globalization of the ICT industry, a single country cannot complete the full product chain coverage of the whole industry and the globalization of the division of labor. The trend is unavoidable, and the market should rationally look at the upstream and downstream impacts of the industry chain. Chairman Xi Jinping’s speech at the forum on cyber security and informationization set the tone for the development of China’s cybertrust business, benefiting the cyber security sector; escalating trade disputes, continuing regional conflicts, and the importance of autonomous controllability, facing fundamental reversal of the industry’s fundamentals. It is optimistic about the direction of military information. Key Recommendations: 【Space Development】, 【Hager Communications】, [National Core Technology], [Jacey Technology], [Eastern Science and Technology], [High-New Emerging], [Halo New Network]; Proposed Focus: [Farfire Communications] , [Xunxun Technology], [Special Information], [XingWang Ruijie], [Xinxinnuo], [Tianyuan Dike], [Philip Lihua], etc.;</li>
<li>ZTE faces difficulties and stands in rational perspective on the impact of the ICT globalization.<br>This week the US Department of Commerce’s ban on ZTE has continued to evolve and the future outcome remains to be seen. The United States Department of Commerce’s ban on the company’s wireless devices in the radio frequency chip, high-speed optical modules, server CPU and other aspects of supply are facing greater pressure on the upstream and downstream industries have varying degrees of impact. From the perspective of the globalization of the ICT industry chain, the industrial chain ecology between China and the United States has gradually formed for more than ten years. They cannot really leave each other, and it is both simple and one-sided to view the upstream and downstream industries from a fragmented perspective. The current event evolution remains to be seen, there is a turning point. In the short term, the ZTE event will affect the market’s expectations for China’s 5G development process. Looking at the medium and long term, the ZTE event will inevitably accelerate China’s autonomous controllable R&amp;D process. The upstream core device and localization of chips is a long-term trend, but it cannot be separated from globalization. The background of the industrial chain of division of labor, even if the United States master high-end chip and component technology, regardless of economic or technical perspectives can not complete the entire industry chain full product coverage, so for the upper reaches of the industry’s autonomy and control should also be reasonably rational perspective.</li>
<li>The central network information strategy has been upgraded, and network information companies have welcomed new opportunities for development.<br>General Secretary Xi Jinping delivered a speech at the symposium on cyber security and informatization, which pointed out the direction for the development of China’s cybertrust business. We believe that in the future, policies will continue to increase over the past few years to promote the construction of network security; industrial integration will promote the digitalization of traditional industries; and military-military integration will deepen the informatization of military industry. From the perspective of policies, the catalysis of the surrounding environment, we are optimistic about the cyber security sector and the direction of military informatization.</li>
<li>In the medium to long-term, we continue to favor the sub-industries such as the Internet of Things, cloud computing, and public security big data.<br>Last week, due to the impact of the Sino-US trade friction escalation, the core components of the Internet of Things and cloud computing have been adjusted. We believe that the sub-industries such as the Internet of Things, cloud computing, and public security big data will usher in accelerated demand growth, and the short-term adjustment will bring about a positive layout. opportunity.<br>Risk Warning: The ZTE event failed to meet expectations; the policy fell below expectations; macroeconomic fluctuations.<br>(2) Merchants Computers: Opportunities for Self-controllable and Pre-empty Opportunities<br>Related Topics: Autonomous and Controllable, Network Information Security<br>Key words this week: Self-controllable. The National Cyber ​​Security and Informatization Conference was held in Beijing on April 20-21. President Xi stressed that he is keen to seize the historical opportunity of informatization development and independent innovation to promote the building of an Internet powerhouse.<br>The computer sector index rose 0.21% this week. At present, the TTM PE of the computer sector is about 56 times. The division of the sector becomes more and more prominent. A new wave of technology with cloud computing and artificial intelligence as the representative technology has arrived. The leading companies in each segment of the A-share computer sector are based on the accumulation of past business and technology. Through the intelligent upgrade of products and services, it is expected to reflect the growth beyond the industry. We are optimistic about the leading investment opportunities.<br>The cyber letter work conference emphasizes self-controllability and industrial digitalization. The National Cyber ​​Security and Informatization Conference was held in Beijing on April 20-21. Secretary General Xi attended the meeting and delivered an important speech, emphasizing that informatization has brought a golden opportunity to the Chinese nation. We must strengthen online positive propaganda and maintain the network. Security; promote the breakthrough in key technologies in the information field; give play to the leading role of informatization in economic and social development; strengthen the integration of military and civilian in cyberspace; actively participate in the international governance of cyberspace; In the recent “ZTE Incident” that exposed the grim reality of China’s weak technology and technology, the high-profile cyber security and informationization work conference has brought cyber security and autonomous control to an unprecedented political height. The rapid development of the Internet in China, but can not deny the lack of core IT technology, including chips, operating systems. On the one hand, China’s self-controllable and catalyzing catalysts are accelerating. On the other hand, it is expected to promote the rapid landing of new-generation technologies such as cloud computing big data.<br>Promote the autonomous and controllable basic IT and strengthen the growth momentum of the digital economy. Under the traditional IT architecture, China’s application software layer and basic hardware layer have basically achieved autonomous control; the localization rate of the basic software layer and basic components is still very low. After the cloud architecture first proposed “going to IOE” in Alibaba Cloud, domestic manufacturers from the bottom IaaS to the upper SaaS have strong competitiveness. China continues to consolidate the power of the Internet, the digital economy has become the core driving force for economic growth, cloud computing and big data technology is the core technology of the digital economy. President Xi clearly pointed out that big data is a new stage in the development of information technology, and plans the development direction of the big data industry from five aspects: promoting industrial innovation, building a digital economy, improving the level of governance, improving people’s livelihood, and ensuring data security. Self-controllable and cybernetic security pre-emptive development opportunities, it is recommended to focus on four aspects: 1) autonomous control of basic IT: China Great Wall, China Software, Shuguang Branch, Inspur Information; 2) Information Security: Venus, NSFOCUS, Wei Shi Tong, and Meiya Bacco; 3) Cloud Computing: UFIDA, GLI, Pan Micro Networks, Baosight Software; 4) E-Government: Tai Chi, Huayu Software.<br>“AI+Cloud” struck, and the strong ones were Hengqiang: A new wave of technology with cloud computing and artificial intelligence as the representative technology has come. We believe that the “New Technology Age” will develop in favor of leading companies in the early stage. The technology leader is expected to rely on the data resources brought by the business, a huge amount of capital accumulation, and the best talent pool to achieve a more prominent competitive advantage in the intelligent era with data as the core. We strongly believe that the leading companies in each segment of the A-share computer segment are building on their past business and technology accumulation. Through the intelligent upgrade of products and services, they have demonstrated growth beyond the industry.<br>Risk Warning: Less than expected policy support; bottleneck in core technology development<br>(3) Merchants Computer: Self-controllable, State-of-the-art<br>Related Topics: Autonomous and Controllable, Network Information Security<br>comment:</li>

The report reviewed the industry information and key announcements this week and maintained the “recommendation” of investment rating for the industry. It is recommended to pay attention to the targets of AVIC Electromechanical, AVIC Shenfei, Zhongzhi, AAC, S4c, Hyland, China Power and aerospace electronics.<br>comment:</li>
<li>From the year 2018 to the present, the national defense industry (Shenwan) index has risen by 0.73%, outperforming the CSI 300 index by 7.43%. Since the Spring Festival, the attention of the military sector has significantly increased, and the overall sector has accumulated a certain increase from the bottom. In the long term, due to the serious oversold in the previous period, the valuation of some of the targets is still low. We believe that from the quarterly disclosures that have been successively disclosed, the listed companies of the Aviation Industry Group of the 12 major military industrial groups have performed brilliantly, which proves that the aviation industry chain continues to maintain a high degree of prosperity. Other civil servants and other military companies have also improved their performance, confirming the improvement of the industry’s fundamentals. In terms of policy benefits: 1. Key reforms such as the equipment procurement system, military product prices, and taxation are expected to achieve breakthroughs during the year; 2. Military spending growth exceeds expectations; 3. SASAC proposes: to strengthen the evaluation of central bank’s market value management, relying on the integration of listed company platforms Quality assets. The gradual release of favorable policies is expected to further boost the market’s attention to the military industry. We are firmly optimistic about the excess returns of the military industry for 18 years. Investment direction: 1. Long-term optimistic about leading enterprises in the middle and lower reaches of the industrial chain; 2. Optimistic about high-tech barriers and strong military-civilian stocks; 3. Optimistic about companies that are actively advancing reforms; focusing on AVIC Mechatronics, AVIC Shenfei, etc. Zhongzhi Stock, China Shipbuilding Defense, Aviation Power, China Power, Four Electronics, and Hyland.</li>
<li>US companies are banned from selling components to ZTE, a Chinese telecommunications equipment manufacturer, within the next seven years. Reuters reported that due to violations of the U.S. government’s sanctions ban, the US Department of Commerce has banned China’s ZTE Corporation from buying component products (including Qualcomm chips, etc.) from the U.S. market for a period of up to 7 years. We believe that the ZTE sanctions imposed by the US embargo has triggered a domestic focus on autonomous and controllable technologies. The research and development of China’s military equipment has always been based on autonomous and controllable requirements, and the localization rate is relatively high. The embargo incident has a limited impact on the production and operation of the military industry in the short term. On the other hand, because the military industry group has supported the country for many years, it has accumulated a number of core technologies. In the future, military-civilian integration can play a greater role in the country’s autonomous controllable business, and it is expected to benefit from it.</li>
<li>Jiang Yang, Vice Chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, visited Guorui Technology. On April 18, Jiang Yang, the vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, visited Guorui Technology Co., Ltd. Chairman Jiang said that China Electronics Group should further play its role as a capital market and enlarge and strengthen its own high-tech companies with independent innovation capabilities so that the capital market can truly serve the country’s innovation-driven development strategy and national economic construction. We believe that this move reflects the emphasis placed by the regulatory authorities on the military industry group. The recent favorable industrial policies have been continuously released, and the market’s attention to the military industry has continuously increased. With the actual landing of various reform policies, it is expected that the profitability of the military industry will continue to increase. First, it will be favorable to military and military OEMs and sub-system suppliers.<br>Risk Warning: The delivery of orders for defense equipment fluctuates, and the market has significantly adjusted.<br>(5) Merchants Retail: Different growth rates under the new retail line, accelerated innovations<br>Related Themes: New Retail<br>[Market performance] Last week, the Shanghai and Shenzhen 300 fell by 2.85%, the retail index fell by 4.28%, ranking the 25th among all the top-level industries.

<li>[Review of Key Reports - Development Direction of New Tea with Net Red Tea]<br>In 2017, the new style of tea has risen rapidly. In Shanghai, many brands such as hi tea and Lele tea are the detonation market. The day before yesterday, Lele Tea opened its new store in Xintiandi in Shanghai. Its queue scene is no less than hi tea. Therefore, this time, we will conduct in-depth tracking of Lele tea in Shanghai and explore the business logic behind the new tea.</li>
<li>[Recent perspectives] Different growth rates under the new retail line, faster innovations, and higher online growth rate<br>Total social retail sales in March 2018 were 10.1% year-on-year, a decrease of 0.8% from the previous quarter and Q1 growth of 9.8%. The total retail sales above the quota amounted to 8.5% year-on-year, and the growth rate in March showed a good quarter-on-quarter trend. In Q18 of 2018, the retail sales of supermarkets, department stores, specialty stores, and specialty stores in retail establishments above designated size increased by 7.7%, 5.5%, 9.5%, and 9.6% year-on-year respectively, and the offline consumption continued to pick up, with department stores, supermarkets, and The growth rate of shopping centers, convenience stores and other industries accelerated. Under the backdrop of new retail sales, offline consumption continued to pick up, and business innovation accelerated and the growth rate increased significantly.<br>3, new retail is the main style of the future.<br>Alibaba began to switch from pure e-commerce platform retail to “platform+self-operated” retail, relying on the national distribution of box-based freshwater, RT-Mart, and hungry, cooperate with word-of-mouth, Alipay and other service-oriented tools to form an omni-channel matrix and occupy traffic. The entrance, deepening the supply chain capacity, in the context of consumer upgrades, the international supply chain into the country, from many aspects to the more tempting to offline consumption, the future will become a staggering retail innovation under the line of fish. We believe that new retail is the main style of the future and that new retail sales will focus more on supply chain capabilities and innovations in format iterations. Extension of department store supply chain, innovation in supermarket formats, and empowerment under e-commerce will lead to a new round of retail investment. opportunity.<br>4, investment advice:<br>The continued deepening of the giant’s local life field will also provide support for the development of the online and offline integration of retail companies, and continue to recommend leading companies in the retail sector: Wangfujing, Chongqing Department Store, and Rainbow shares in the department store sector, Yonghui Supermarket in the supermarket sector, and households Yue, professional chain stores Suning Tesco, e-commerce field Alibaba, Jingdong, Pozun e-commerce and so on.<br>Risk Warning: Resident consumption growth is less than expected; online and offline integration is less than expected.<br>Second, the theme of market performance review<br>The recent market volatility has been spurred by the US ZTE embargo, and the topics such as localization of chips and nuclear high base have gained a lot. In addition, the 3D sensing, artificial intelligence, and regional themes have also risen to the top, from monthly and quarterly gains. Looking at the overall rise of science and technology, it basically confirms the judgment that we have come from the end of February on the right of the theme of science and technology. From the perspective of thematic rotation, we can focus on the opportunities for the rotation of state-owned enterprise reforms and other topics. From the mid- to long-term perspective, emerging technology themes and advanced manufacturing topics will benefit long-term from technological progress and policy support, and continue to favor technology and advanced manufacturing topics for a long time.</li>
